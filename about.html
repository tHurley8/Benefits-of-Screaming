                            <p> You're not alone! the use of screams for mental and physical relief may not be a new concept but our company, screams, uses this to our advantage. Screaming- though releaving- is not accepted in all places, for example an office building. With the help of our naturally sorced screams we provide a way to keep the benifits of releasing these emotions while taking away the disruptiveness.</p>
